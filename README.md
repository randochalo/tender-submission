## How to Use

### Adding a New Tender

1. Create a new folder under the appropriate category (e.g., `IT/TSH-XXX/`)
2. Use the next available number in sequence
3. Create a `README.md` inside the folder with tender details
4. Add documents to the appropriate subfolders:
   - `documents/` - Official tender notice, addendums
   - `quotations/` - Price quotations, BOQ, financial proposals
   - `technical/` - Technical specifications, drawings, proposals
   - `company/` - Company profile, certifications, financial statements
   - `submission/` - Final compiled submission package
5. Update this README.md with the new tender information

### Folder Structure per Tender

Each TSH-XXX folder contains:

```
TSH-XXX/
├── README.md           # Tender details, checklist, progress
├── documents/          # Official tender documents
│   └── .gitkeep
├── quotations/         # Price quotations and BOQ
│   └── .gitkeep
├── technical/          # Technical proposals and specs
│   └── .gitkeep
├── company/            # Company profile and certifications
│   └── .gitkeep
└── submission/         # Final submission documents
    └── .gitkeep
```

## Guidelines

1. **Naming Convention:** Use TSH-XXX format (Tender Submission #XXX)
2. **Documentation:** Always include a README.md in each submission folder
3. **File Organization:** Store documents in the appropriate subfolder:
   - Official documents → `documents/`
   - Pricing/BOQ → `quotations/`
   - Technical specs → `technical/`
   - Company info → `company/`
   - Final package → `submission/`
4. **Version Control:** Use Git commits to track changes
5. **Confidentiality:** Do not commit sensitive pricing in plain text (use password-protected PDFs)
