## How to Use

### Adding a New Tender

1. Create a new folder under the appropriate category (e.g., `IT/TSH-XXX/`)
2. Use the next available number in sequence
3. Create a `README.md` inside the folder with tender details
4. Add all relevant documents (PDFs, images, spreadsheets)
5. Update this index.md with the new tender information

### Folder Template

Each TSH-XXX folder should contain:

```
TSH-XXX/
├── README.md           # Tender details and summary
├── documents/          # Official tender documents
├── quotations/         # Price quotations and BOQ
├── technical/          # Technical proposals and specs
├── company/            # Company profile and certifications
└── submission/         # Final submission documents
```

## Guidelines

1. **Naming Convention:** Use TSH-XXX format (Tender Submission #XXX)
2. **Documentation:** Always include a README.md in each submission folder
3. **File Organization:** Keep documents in appropriate subfolders
4. **Version Control:** Use Git commits to track changes
5. **Confidentiality:** Do not commit sensitive pricing in plain text
