1.3.

JMYR Sdn. Bhd. is a Malaysia-based issuer of a MYR-denominated stablecoin,
operating as a settlement provider and programmable payment rail. As part of its next
phase of growth, JMYR is expanding beyond issuance into real-world use cases,
ecosystem integrations, and market adoption.

The stablecoin and tokenized payments landscape is evolving rapidly, driven by demand
for faster cross-border settlement, improved transparency, and compliance-aligned

5. Risk and Constraints

This section outlines key risks and constraints that vendors must consider when preparing their

proposals.

Risk

Constraints

Operational Readiness
Limited internal expertise or
resource availability may
impact implementation
timelines, partner onboarding,
or ongoing operational support.

Technology partners must provide sufficient training,
documentation, and operational support to enable
JMYR’s teams to operate the solution effectively.

Project timelines must account for internal readiness
and resource availability. Integration readiness
requirements that may be deferred during a sandbox
phase are expected to be fully addressed prior to
commercial deployment.

Third-Party Lock-In
Over-reliance on a single
technology provider may
reduce flexibility and increase
switching costs in the future.

The proposed solution must be designed for portability
and scalability from the outset. This includes the use of
standards-based interfaces, avoidance of
vendor-exclusive infrastructure or nodes, and support
for multi-region or multi-operator deployment.

Proposals for commercialisation must include
contractual safeguards such as exit provisions, escrow
arrangements for critical assets, and defined migration
support within service level agreements (SLAs).

Timeline

Delays in delivery may result in
the project exceeding
regulator-approved timelines.

The project is intended to support potential submission
to the Securities Commission Malaysia’s Regulatory
Sandbox and/or Bank Negara Malaysia’s Digital Asset
Innovation Hub (DAIH), subject to regulatory
assessment and approval.

Vendors must be prepared to support testing and
delivery within timelines approved by the relevant
regulators, which may include accelerated schedules.

Regulatory Interpretation &
Change

Differences in regulatory
interpretation or changes in
regulatory requirements may
impact solution design, delivery
scope, or implementation
timelines.

The proposed solution must be designed with flexibility
to accommodate evolving regulatory requirements.
Vendors are expected to support updates, configuration
changes, or control enhancements required by
regulators during sandbox testing and prior to
commercial deployment, without fundamental redesign
of the solution.
