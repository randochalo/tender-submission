## 1. Purpose and Objective

### 1.1

JMYR Sdn. Bhd. is a Malaysia-based issuer of a MYR-denominated stablecoin, operating as a settlement provider and programmable payment rail. As part of its next phase of growth, JMYR is expanding beyond issuance into real-world use cases, ecosystem integrations, and market adoption.

### 1.2

The stablecoin and tokenized payments landscape is evolving rapidly, driven by demand for faster cross-border settlement, improved transparency, and compliance-aligned digital payment infrastructure. In Malaysia, regulatory sandbox initiatives and ongoing policy developments related to JMYR indicate a clear regulatory direction toward compliant, fiat-backed digital settlement solutions.

### 1.3

In this context, JMYR Sdn. Bhd. is issuing this Request for Proposal (RFP) to identify qualified partners for use cases, integrations, and collaborations involving the JMYR Stablecoin. This includes, but is not limited to, cross-border payment gateway implementation, audit and attestation services for reserve backing, and marketing or go-to-market partnerships. The objective is to support rapid cross-border settlement, regulatory-compliant operations, and user experiences suitable for both institutional and retail partners.

This RFP is intended to provide a high-level overview of JMYR's objectives and requirements and does not purport to contain all information that may be relevant to respondents.
